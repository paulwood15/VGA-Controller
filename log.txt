> Tried looking into making a SATA and AHCI controller, but it wouldn't be doable. Going to stick with SPI flash and DDR2.
    >> PMOD ports output 3V3 max 1.0A and will need to be steped down to 1.8 +-1% for DDR2 and probably flash as well. Use a huge capacitor bank!
    >> There are specific power-on sequences that must be followed to avoid latchup or high inrush currents - DDR doesn't look at complicated at the FPGA power design and nexys uses asynchronous for ddr
    >> DDR2: once voltage sequence is complete, certain instructions need to be run before anything can be read/written
    >> Refer to Nexys and basys schematics 
    >> Nexys DDR2 capacitor bank:
        2 - 4.7nF
        4 - 10nF
        4 - 47nF
        6 - 470nF

> Might attempt to do a SODIMM DDR2 board but it would require 4 ICs ($$) for single ranked 
    >> If I do this then I will need to choose ICs that are x16
